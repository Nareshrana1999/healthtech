## 📦 After Build Completes (~10-15 min)

### 1. Download the APK

The build logs will show a download link, or run:
```powershell
eas build:list
```

Look for "Application Archive URL" - that's your APK download link!

### 2. Test the APK

1. Download APK to your Android device
2. Enable "Unknown Sources" in Settings
3. Install and test the app

### 3. Create GitHub Release

Once tested and working:

```powershell
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "HealthTech v1.0.0 - First Release"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger GitHub Actions to build:
- ✅ Android APK (direct install)
- ✅ Android AAB (Google Play Store)
- ✅ iOS IPA (App Store)
